Detection of fake news as an element of the information management system in the organization in the conditions of a war situation
In the present digital age, the phenomenon of fake news has taken centre stage in the realm of journalism, becoming a critical issue, especially in the context of war. The dissemination of propaganda and misinformation during periods of military conflict poses significant challenges for information management in organizations, particularly those operating in the news industry. Understanding how organizations function, gather information, and detect fake news during war situations is crucial for effective information management and safeguarding the integrity of news. 
One such organization that plays a pivotal role in news dissemination is an internet news portal. These portals function as platforms that collect, curate, and deliver news content to the audience. In the face of war, internet news portals face unique challenges in gathering accurate information and combatting the spread of fake news. The advent of machine learning tools has provided promising avenues for detecting and mitigating fake news, but their effectiveness and applicability in war contexts require further exploration.
This research seeks to address these gaps by investigating the role of information management and the application of machine learning tools in an internet news portal during war situations. By examining the functionality and information gathering processes of the portal, we aim to understand the unique characteristics and challenges that arise during war. Additionally, we will explore the use of machine learning tools in detecting fake news and the differences in keyword usage between normal times and war times. Specifically, we will investigate if there are variations in the keywords used to detect fake news in different war contexts, such as the Iraq, Syrian and Ukrainian unfortunate wars.
